    "## **Len's Slice**\n",
    "\n",
    "You work at Len’s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. You are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some of your sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Make Some Pizzas**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of the kinds of pizzas you sell, create a list called `toppings` that holds the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"pepperoni\"`\n",
    "- `\"pineapple\"`\n",
    "- `\"cheese\"`\n",
    "- `\"sausage\"`\n",
    "- `\"olives\"`\n",
    "- `\"anchovies\"`\n",
    "- `\"mushrooms\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "It should look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "toppings = [\"pepperoni\", \"pineapple\", \"cheese\", \"sausage\", \"olives\", \"anchovies\", \"mushrooms\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of how much each kind of pizza slice costs, create a list called `prices` that holds the following integer values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2`\n",
    "- `6`\n",
    "- `1`\n",
    "- `3`\n",
    "- `2`\n",
    "- `7`\n",
    "- `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need the quotes when you are dealing with integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "prices = [2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your boss wants you to do some research on $2 slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Count the number of occurrences of `2` in the `prices` list, and store the result in a variable called `num_two_dollar_slices`. Print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `.count` to find the number of occurrences of a value in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [\"a\", \"a\", \"b\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "number_of_as = my_list.count(\"a\")\n",
    "# number_of_as is 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the length of the `toppings` list and store it in a variable called `num_pizzas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `len()` to find the length of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "len(toppings)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the string `We sell [num_pizzas] different kinds of pizza!`, where `[num_pizzas]` represents the value of our variable `num_pizzas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a variable to a string, you can use the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"My age is \" + str(my_age)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You have to cast the number as a string before you add it to another string!\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "We sell 7 different kinds of pizza!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the existing data about the pizza toppings and prices to create a new two-dimensional list called `pizza_and_prices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sublist in `pizza_and_prices` should have one pizza topping and an associated price.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Price | Topping |\n",

    "| 2 | \"pepperoni\" |\n",
    "| 6 | \"pineapple\" |\n",

    "| 2 | \"olives\" |\n",
    "| 7 | \"anchovies\" |\n",
    "| 2 | \"mushrooms\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "For this new list make sure the prices come before the topping name like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[price, topping_name]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You don’t need to use your original `toppings` and `prices` lists in this exercise. Create a new two-dimensional list from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first sublist in the two-dimensional list would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[2, \"pepperoni\"]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Print `pizza_and_prices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it look the way you expect?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[2, 'pepperoni'], [6, 'pineapple'], [1, 'cheese'], [3, 'sausage'], [2, 'olives'], [7, 'anchovies'], [2, 'mushrooms']]\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Sorting and Slicing Pizzas**\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort `pizza_and_prices` so that the pizzas are in the order of increasing price (ascending).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "You can sort a list from low to high by using `.sort()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list.sort()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When sorting a two-dimensional list using `.sort()`, the list by default will be sorted by the first element in each sublist. In this case, this will mean it is sorted by the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the first element of `pizza_and_prices` in a variable called `cheapest_pizza`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an element of a list, use the syntax `list[n]`, where `n` is the index of the item you want to get. Remember that list indices start at zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "second_item = your_list[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**10.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A man walks into the pizza store and shouts “I will have your MOST EXPENSIVE pizza!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Get the last item of the `pizza_and_prices` list and store it in a variable called `priciest_pizza`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the last element of a list, use the syntax `list[-1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "last_item = your_list[-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**11.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like the most expensive pizza from the previous step was our very last `\"anchovies\"` slice. Remove it from our `pizza_and_prices` list since the man bought the last slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove the last element of a list, use the `.pop()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no longer an `\"anchovies\"` pizza, you want to add a new topping called `\"peppers\"` to keep your customers excited about new toppings. Here is what your new topping looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[2.5, \"peppers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the new peppers pizza topping to our list `pizza_and_prices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Make sure to position it relative to the rest of the sorted data in `pizza_and_prices`, otherwise our data will not be correctly sorted anymore!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the new pizza has a price of `2.5`, it should come after `[2, \"pepperoni\"]` but before `[3, \"sausage\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `.insert()` method to insert an element at a specific index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**13.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Three mice walk into the store. They don’t have much money (they’re mice), but they do each want different pizzas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slice the `pizza_and_prices` list and store the 3 lowest cost pizzas in a list called `three_cheapest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the first `n` items of a list, use `list[:n]`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_list = my_list[:2]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would store the first two items of `my_list` in `new_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14.**\n",
    "\n",
